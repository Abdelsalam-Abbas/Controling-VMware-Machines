I wanted to automate the way I run my CentOS machine which I use to study RHCA so I made this script 



#  First Run
## You need to provide the script at first run with :-
  1.  vmx file ".vmx"
  2.  Machine IP 
  3.  Machine Name
 
#  Usage: vm-control start|stop|conf|reset
    start: start The Machine and connect to it
    stop: stop The Machine 
    reset: delete Script configuration
    conf: add your VMware Workstation configuration

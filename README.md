This is a script I use to run My Centos VMware machine and I may make this more dynamic to be able to run any VMware machine

  First Run
    You need to provide the script at first run with :-
      vmx file
      Machine IP 
      Machine Name
 
  Usage: vm-control start|stop|conf|reset
    start: start VMware workstatoin
    stop: stop  VMware workstatoin
    reset: delete Script configuration 
    conf: add your VMware Workstation configuration
